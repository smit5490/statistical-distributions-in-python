# Statistical Distributions in Python
**Author**: Robert Smith

Github repository for the `statdist` Python package available on Pypi. This package contains code
for the gaussian and binomial distributions.  

## Python Files in statdist Package
- *Generaldistribution.py*: Contains basic attributes of all distributions.
- *Gaussiandistribution.py*: Instantiate and explore gaussian probability distributions.
- *Binomialdistribution.py*: Instantiate and explore binomial probability distributions.

## Installation
Download from pip:

`pip install statdist`

Note: I created the skeleton of this package as part of Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree program. 
Since then, I have extended its capabilities and used pytest to perform unit tests.
